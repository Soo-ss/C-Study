/*
auto variable == local variable

the function fun() expects a double pointer
Fun() modifies the value at address pptr. The value at address pptr is
pointer p as we pass address of p to fun(). In fun(), value at pptr is
changed to address of q. Therefore, pointer p fo main() is changed to point
to a new variable q.

Also, note that the program won't cause any out of scope problem because
q is a static variable. Static variables exist in memory even
after function return.
For an auto variable, we might seen some unexpected output because auto variable
may not exist int memory after functions return.
